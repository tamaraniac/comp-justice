Making a Snap Account
=====================

In this course, we'll be using `Snap <https://snap.berkeley.edu/index>`_. In order to use Snap and save your projects, you'll need to make an account. To get started, navigate to the sign up page `here <https://snap.berkeley.edu/sign_up>`_.

It will ask you to provide a username, password, month of birth (to verify your age), and an email address.

For your username, please use *[YOUR UNIQNAME]-um* where "YOUR UNIQNAME" is your uniqname. (or your UM email without the @umich.edu) We recommend you use your UM email address for the email.

Then, check the box to agree to the terms and conditions, click Sign Up and you're all set to start creating!
